                <p class="bg-text">I spent my entire life pursuing the game of football. It took me to Chapel Hill, NC where I played 5 years while earning a double major in Sport Admin and English. It was my dream to play professionally and I got the opportunity to truly live it out. But all good things must come to an end, and I find myself looking forward to the next chapter.</p>
                <h2 class='bg-title'>...Where I'm Going</h2>
                <p class="bg-text">The summer before my last camp (in 2019) I discovered a new potential passion in coding and software development. As the sun set on my football career I saw opportunity rise on a new path. I plan on chasing software engineering with the same veracious passion that I chased the game of football. I look forward to putting my skills to use and contributing to this industry. I am looking forward to developing applications and web pages for my side ventures like podcasting and coaching!</p>
