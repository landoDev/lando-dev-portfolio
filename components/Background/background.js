            <p>I spent my entire life pursuing the game of football. It took me to Chapel Hill, NC where I played 5 years while earning a double major in Sport Admin and English. It was my dream to play professionally and I got the opportunity to truly live it out. But all good things must come to an end, and I find myself looking forward to the next chapter.</p>
